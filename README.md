## Standard Practices
In an attempt to keep the development process clean and cooperative, there will be several rules that will be enforced for the project. The rules listed below are to be followed to the best of the developers ability. By adhering to these rules, it will allow for the codebase to only contain readable code, simplify the pull-request and merge process, and properly track open issues within the project.

1. Fork the Repository: In the top right hand corner of the repository, there is a fork button. By clicking on this, the repository is essentially pulling the repo into their own account, allowing them to make changes to their own version of the repository. Confirmed changes will then be moved from the developers repository to the main repo. 
1. Create Feature Branches: On the version of your repo, feature branches should be created for developing new features. By doing this, you are avoiding creating a branch that contains changes to multiple different functionalities of the code which potentially will cause confusion and introduce more bugs into the branch. For changes that need to be quickly made, you can create a hot-fix branch, make the change and merge the branch back into the codebase.
1. Track issues with Zenhub: For all issues that are found in the repository, they should be added to Zenhub and notify the person in charge in making the change. 
1. Write readable code: It is imperative that we are only adding code into the codebase that is properly formatted and has necessary comments. While this might be a friction point for some this will allow others to come in and understand what the code is doing. This is essential for us to all stay productive and time efficient, and will also help us write maintainable code.
1. Assign reviewers to a Pull Request: When a pull request is submitted, you must tag all the group members of the project (or just one if a certain person is needed) so they get an email notification about the pull request. Since a pull request can only be merged if it has been approved by atleast one person, this is important.
1. Add all research done into the Research folder: This rule is self explanatory. The importance of this rule is that the Research folder can be used as a reference for all developers when needing to look something up.
